# GoogleTranslateClone
This is a simple clone of google translate built using streamlit and Langchain chatmodel.

## Frameworks used:
- [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) is a web-app framework, that lets you turn the scripts into wonderful apps by taking care of front-end and back-end of the app with in few lines of code. 
- [Langchain chat models](https://js.langchain.com/docs/modules/models/chat) lets you assign role to the LLM, which in our case is language translation between different languages. Then, the user will be able to request a translation.
